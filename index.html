                <i>Echoes of Angmar</i> offers a true vanilla experience with all content up to and including
                <b>Volume I, Book 11</b> faithfully recreated. This means original zones and quest chains,
                complete (pre-split) instances, and yes, even the old trait system. You use the original
                client to connect to our server. No cash shop, no quest helper, original difficulty. We hope you
                still remember how to get around the Old Forest without a map!
            </p>
            <p>
                The server is currently under active development. <b>Public stress-testing is expected to begin in
                late summer 2022</b>, with open beta coming shortly after. We will post all necessary information
                here as we get closer to launch so keep an eye on this page if you're interested in joining the testing.

            <h3 class="w3-center">HOW TO CONNECT</h3>
            <h4>1. Download & install the game client</h4>
            <p>
                You will need the original 2007 EU (Codemasters) client patched to Book 11 content. We don't provide the client
                but it can be found around the internet, for example <a href="http://130.89.149.23/pub/games/lotro/book11/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend that you select the "Custom" installation option and install the client into a custom folder 
                (such as D:\Games\Echoes of Angmar) to avoid issues with Windows UAC. Make sure to also select the high
                resolution texture pack when prompted!
            </p>
            <p>
                After installation, do <b>not</b> launch the game, doing so will corrupt your client!
            </p>

            <h4>2. Download the Echoes of Angmar launcher</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Download link will be provided once the server is ready.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to unpack the downloaded archive into your client install directory - for example
                D:\Games\Echoes of Angmar. If you installed the client into the default location, it will be in
                C:\Program Files (x86)\Codemasters\The Lord of the Rings Online.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply unzip the archive into this folder to install the launcher, then launch EchoesLauncher.exe
                to start the game. You can drag EchoesLauncher.exe to your system taskbar to create a shortcut.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Create a game account</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Account creation link will be provided once the server is ready.</em>
            </p>

            <h4>4. Play!</h4>
            <p>
                Enter your login credentials when prompted by the launcher. If the server is online, you can now hit Play!
                If the server is full, you will be placed into a queue. Keep in mind that closing the launcher while queued up
                will cost you your spot!

            <h3 class="w3-center">GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
                Our goal is to create a positive game environment and foster a healthy community. We will take action against
                any conduct that we consider disruptive to that vision, regardless of whether it is explicitly mentioned in
                these rules or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please understand that breaking server rules will generally result in a <b>permanent account ban</b> and thus
                loss of access to all characters on that account. If in doubt, don't do it!
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">CONDUCT</h3>
            <p>
                We won't tolerate any sort of harassment, abuse or griefing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Foul language, toxicity, spam and off-topic conversation of any kind are not permitted in public chat channels.
                This applies to /say, all zone channels (Regional, OOC, Advice, ...) and global channels (world, glff, ...) that are
                publicly advertised. Private tells (whispers) follow the same rules if the recipient reports them.
                We will not police fellowship or kinship chat, nor any private global channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only English is allowed in the game's public channels (as defined above). For communication in other languages,
                please create a user channel. Bi-lingual advertisement of such channels, or of non-English speaking kinships,
                using regular global channels is allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Character and kinship names that are offensive or make overt realm-world references (especially political or
                otherwise controversial) are prohibited. Please note that use of special chracters to bypass the game's
                foul language filter will be considered a violation, as will using non-English slurs in your names.
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">EXPLOITS & CHEATING</h3>
            <p>
                If you discover an exploit (meaning any action that provides an in-game advantage outside of normal rules), please
                report it. Taking advantage of such exploits will of course result in a ban for everyone involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes, but is not limited to: item and currency multiplication, invulnerability, effect stacking,
                item consumption (e.g. using potions without spending them, crafting without ingredients, etc.),
                bypassing encounter mechanics and exploiting monster or pet AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheating is likewise strictly prohibited. This includes any sort of speed hacks, client memory manipulation,
                packet alteration, modifying client data in a way that affects gameplay, etc. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">MULTIBOXING & AUTOMATION</h3>
            <p>
                Running multiple clients simultaneously in PvE is allowed, as long as no input automation is used and no other rules
                are being broken. As a rule of thumb, having a second character on /follow is OK, anything beyond that is not
                recommended. If running multiple characters, make sure to avoid any in-game behavior that could be considered
                unfair, such as camping mob or resource spawns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiboxing is strictly prohibited in PvMP, without exception.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any other form of automation is also prohibited. Botting and AFK play in particular will result in
                a ban not only for the account that engaged in it but also for any characters that were traded (through direct
                trade or otherwise) any items collected by the bot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of keystroke macros is generally not allowed, especially where it leads to input spam and increased
                load on the server.
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">THE PROJECT</h3>

            <p class="faq-q">"What is Echoes of Angmar? Is it true SoA?"</p>
            <p>
                EoA is a faithful recreation of the game as it was back in 2007. It uses the original client, meaning the graphics,
                landscapes, instances etc. are all exactly as they used to be back in the day. Server-side information that
                is not directly present in the client had to be recreated from references. Where these are lacking we had to
                make some guesses so the experience isn't 100% the same - but it's as close as it gets.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Is this a #nochanges project or are you making adjustments to content, balance, etc.?"</p>
            <p>
                We try to keep everything as close to the original as possible. We will not be making any changes beyond
                bug fixes, unless there's a technical reason to do so. This may change in the future as we start looking
                at our long-term plans for the server but for now the project is strictly #nochanges.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Why Book 11 specifically?"</p>
            <p>
                We are limited by what client patches are publicly available on the Internet. Book 11 is the latest available
                patch that has all the important content (Annúminas and The Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu in particular) but that still
                predates many of the later landscape nerfs and changes (such as the Angmar revamp, Old Forest map, etc.)
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Will you ever release any of the later SoA patches?"</p>
            <p>
                We will consider upgrading the server to Book 14 at a later date if there's enough demand (and will) for it.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Will we ever see Moria, Mirkwood, etc?"</p>
            <p>
                Unlikely. We have no plans for any versions of the game beyond SoA.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Is this a progressive server? What will be available at launch?"</p>
            <p>
                The server will release with PvE content roughly equivalent to the original Book 8 (aka SoA launch content). Some zones
                that were not available at SoA release may be closed off (Evendim, High Pass, Tâl Bruinen, ...) and open later with their
                respective Book patches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional content will be released over time, more or less as it did back in the day:
                <ul>
                    <li>Book 9: Evendim, Barad Gúlaran, Helegrod</li>
                    <li>Book 10: Annúminas and its dungeons, Sarnúr, Haudh Iarchith</li>
                    <li>Book 11: Tâl Bruinen, High Pass, Goblin-town, The Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The housing system and session play (chicken play and Ettenmoors PvMP) will release When It's Ready™. There will be a
                separate Beta for PvMP before its full release.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Will there be festivals?"</p>
            <p>
                We will try to make festivals available at a later date. We don't have any concrete plans as to when, though.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Is the server source code available? Can I run my own server?"</p>
            <p>
                No. We will not be releasing the server source code.
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">BETA & TESTING</h3>
            
            <p class="faq-q">"What is the Stress Test?"</p>
            <p>
                We will be running a series of short tests (couple of hours to 1-2 days at a time) aimed at testing the server under realistic
                load. This is to prepare the server for its Beta phase. It will be open to the public so please keep an eye on this page for updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Needless to say, there will be server wipes between individual Stress Tests and before Beta opens.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"How will the Beta work?"</p>
            <p>
                During the Beta phase, we will start with a character level cap that enables access to all starter content. When that content is
                tested, we will gradually raise the level cap and open up content/instances until we reach parity with our planned launch
                content (e.g. Book 8).
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"How long will the Beta last?"</p>
            <p>
                As long as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will adjust the duration of each level cap phase as we see fit. We will try to keep a healthy pace but we won't advance
                the server if there are major outstanding bugs or known exploits that would hinder the server in the long run.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Will there be a wipe after Beta?"</p>
            <p>
                Our current plan is to <b>not</b> wipe the server after Beta. We will transition into full release seamlessly after hitting
                the level cap and fixing all the major bugs that were discovered during testing. There will likely be a transitional period
                after the Beta concludes and before our first post-launch content release to give players who did not participate in the Beta
                a chance to catch up. It is possible that Evendim will be released during this transitional phase to provide new alt leveling
                options for our Beta testers.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"So the Beta is really just a gradual launch?"</p>
            <p>
                Not really. We expect to see bugs and server crashes during the Beta phase. You may need to repeat broken quests, replace
                lost items, accept that instance bosses are bugged, etc. Server crashes can disrupt your progress, kick you out of instances
                or make you log back surrounded by hostile mobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                During Beta, our Game Masters will <b>not</b> provide assistance with these issues (such as replace lost items, complete
                quests for you, etc.) so please keep that in mind if you decide to join the testing.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"What if there are major exploits used during the Beta to gain unfair advantage?"</p>
            <p>
                We will do whatever is necessary to amend the situation. We could remove items and/or currency, roll
                back quest completion etc. at our discretion. We will do our best to avoid doing this but we will do what's best for
                the health of the server and its community.
            </p>
            <p>
                All <a href="#rules">server rules</a> apply during the Beta so offenders will the banned if engaging in known exploits.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"Should I participate in the Beta?"</p>
            <p>
                Our Beta is very much like an "Early Access" - you get to play early, but you will probably need to endure
                some inconvenience and work around some rough edges. You can try the game and if its state isn't polished enough for you,
                simply park your character and come back when we transition into a full release!
            </p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
            
            <p class="faq-q">"The launcher says it couldn't patch a file and that I may need to reinstall the client!"</p>
            <p>
                Make sure you see files like <i>client_anim.dat</i> and <i>lotroclient.exe</i> in your client install folder. We've seen
                people simply unzip the client installer and place the launcher files next to it. Make sure you run <i>lotrosetup.exe</i>
                and place the launcher files into the game folder it creates.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the launcher is in the right directory, you might have started TurbineLauncher instead of EchoesLauncher by mistake and
                your client files were modified. You will have to re-install the client to get back to the original state. You can also
                delete the TurbineLauncher executable to avoid making this mistake.
            </p>

            <p class="faq-q">"I'm in game but I can't move or perform any other actions!"</p>
            <p>
                The server probably crashed. Close the client and log in again using the launcher - the server should be back online soon.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                This is not limited to bugs. If you have a good reference for mob placement, boss mechanics, scripting etc. that you think
                we got wrong, please share it with us through the bugtracker! Just keep in mind that "I'm 100% sure Guard should do more
                damage" does <i>not</i> qualify as "good reference" <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-wink"></i>.
